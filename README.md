# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Ph.D. student at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. Guoqing Wang. Before, I worked as an AI algorithm engineer at [East Hope Group (China)](http://www.easthope.cn/) and as a Research Associate in the [Sensors, Clouds, and Services Laboratory (SCSLab)](http://scslab.net/) at the University of Sydney.

- Background: Research Master Student under Prof. Athman Bouguettaya with a strong interdisciplinary background in Computer Science and Electronic Information Science.
- Research Focus: Deep Learning, Time-series, Multimodal, Trustworthy Machine Learning, Industrial AI algorithms.
- Publications:
  - [Energy Loss Prediction in IoT Energy Services](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10248251)
  - [Monitoring Efficiency of IoT Wireless Charging](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10150276)
  - [Towards Peer-to-Peer Sharing of Wireless Energy Services](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-26507-5_38)
- Industry Experience: AI algorithm development across various sectors (electrolytic aluminum, polysilicon, industrial silicon, equipment diagnostics) including time series prediction, intelligent detection, optimization algorithms, and fault diagnosis.

I am always open to interesting research collaborations and discussions. Feel free to connect with me!
