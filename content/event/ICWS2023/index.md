[**About IEEE ICWS**](https://conferences.computer.org/icws/2023/)

The International Conference on Web Services (ICWS) has been a prime international forum for both researchers and industry practitioners to exchange the latest fundamental advances in the state of the art and practice of Web-based services, identify emerging research topics, and define the future of Web-based services. All topics regarding Web-based services lifecycle study and management align with the theme of ICWS.

[**About IEEE WORLD CONGRESS ON SERVICES**](https://conferences.computer.org/services/2023/)

SERVICES 2023 is a hybrid event, solely sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society under the auspice of the Technical Community on Services Computing (TCSVC). The scope of SERVICES 2023 covers all aspects of services computing and applications, current or emerging. Centered around services computing, SERVICES 2023 covers various systems and networking research pertaining to cloud, edge and Internet-of Things (IoT), as well as technologies for intelligent computing, learning, Big Data and blockchain applications, addressing critical issues such as knowledge network, high performance, security, privacy, dependability, trustworthiness, and cost-effectiveness. Particularly, the 2023 Congress will welcome papers on the aftermath and the impact of COVID-19 on services and the world infrastructure. In addition to co-located theme-topic conferences, the Congress will also include symposia and workshops supporting deep-dive discussions on emerging important topics, and complement the SERVICES 2023 program with industry and application presentations and panels. Authors are invited to prepare early and submit original papers to any of these conferences at www.easychair.org. All submitted manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by at least three reviewers. Accepted and presented papers will appear in the conference proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. SERVICES 2023 is the only premier professional event for the services computing field offered by IEEE.
