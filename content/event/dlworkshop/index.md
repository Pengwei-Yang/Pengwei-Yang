The workshop covers the following topics in detail:

- Utilizing generative models for filling missing values in time series data: This topic explores the application of generative models, such as autoencoders or variational autoencoders, to fill the gaps or missing values in time series data. These models are trained to learn the underlying patterns and dependencies in the data, allowing them to generate plausible values for the missing entries.

- Employing attention mechanisms for video summarization and recommendation: This topic focuses on using attention mechanisms, a key component in deep learning models, to improve video summarization and recommendation systems. Attention mechanisms enable the model to focus on important video segments or frames, capturing the most relevant information for summarization and personalized recommendations.

- Novel optimization approach for Swin Transformers: Swin Transformers are a recent advancement in the field of computer vision, known for their ability to efficiently process image data with large receptive fields. This topic presents a new optimization approach specifically designed for Swin Transformers, aiming to enhance their performance in tasks such as image classification or object detection. The approach involve architectural modifications, training techniques, and optimization algorithms tailored for Swin Transformers.

These are just a few of the topics covered in the workshop, providing attendees with insights into the latest advancements and techniques in the field of deep learning.
