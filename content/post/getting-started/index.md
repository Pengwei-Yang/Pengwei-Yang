## Book Overview

This volume constitutes the revised selected papers from 4 workshops: 

Workshop on Adaptive Service-oriented and Cloud Applications (ASOCA 2022), 3rd International Workshop on AI-enabled Process Automation (AI-PA 2022),  3rd International Workshop on Architectures for Future Mobile Computing and Internet of Things (FMCIoT 2022), and 18th International Workshop on Engineering Service-Oriented Applications and Cloud Services (WESOACS 2022) held in conjunction with the 20th International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing, ICSOC 2022. The conference was held in Sevilla, Spain, in November/December 2022.

## Abstract

Crowdsourcing wireless energy services is a novel convenient alternative to charge IoT devices. We demonstrate peer-to-peer wireless energy services sharing between smartphones over a distance. Our demo leverages (1) a service-based technique to share energy services, (2) state-of-the-art power transfer technology over a distance, and (3) a mobile application to enable communication between energy providers and consumers. In addition, our application monitors the charging process between IoT devices to collect a dataset for further analysis. Moreover, in this demo, we compare the peer-to-peer energy transfer between two smartphones using different charging technologies, i.e., cable charging, reverse charging, and wireless charging over a distance. A set of preliminary experiments have been conducted on a real collected dataset to analyze and demonstrate the behavior of the current wireless and traditional charging technologies.
