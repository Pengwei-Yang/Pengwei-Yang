              Hi there!üëã I am a Ph.D. student at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). Previously, I worked as an Algorithm Engineer at [East Hope Group (China)](http://www.easthope.cn/) and as a Research Associate in the [Sensors, Clouds, and Services Laboratory (SCSLab)](http://scslab.net/) at the University of Sydney. My research centers on time-series analysis and multimodal learning.
              
              I am always open to interesting research collaborations and discussions. Feel free to connect with me!
